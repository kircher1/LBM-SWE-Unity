# LBM-SWE-Unity
This repository contains a Unity package with a simulator for shallow water flows, based on the D2Q9 model of the Lattice Boltzmann method.

I wanted to try out Unity jobs and Burst compilation and an LBM simulation is very paralellizable i.e., it is good problem to solve with jobs and Burst. (Compute shaders would also be a great tool.)

The algorithm and equations are explained excellently and in great detail by [Zhou, J. G. (2013). _Lattice Boltzmann Methods for Shallow Water Flows_ (2004th ed.). Springer.](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-08276-8)
